# Petta-Lab

This repository contains all files created in the Petta Lab for Quantum Computing under the supervision of Professor Jason Petta and Graduate Student Adam Mills.

This repository primarily contains control software written in Python for automated retrieval and monitoring of sensor data from several quantum computing hardware stations and subsystems.

Initial projects include monitoring of a compressor to detect inflow and outflow of water as well as ambient pressure for the purposes on initiating a switch in the water supply between lab water and city water for the station's water cooling system.
