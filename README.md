# Petta-Lab

This repository contains all files created in and for the Petta Lab for Quantum Computing with work done under the supervision of Professor Jason Petta and Graduate Student Adam Mills starting in March 2019.

This repository primarily contains control software written in Python (Python 3) for automated retrieval and monitoring of sensor data from several quantum computing hardware stations and subsystems.

Initial projects include monitoring of a compressor to detect inflow and outflow of water as well as ambient pressure for the purposes on initiating a switch in the water supply between lab water and city water for the station's water cooling system.
